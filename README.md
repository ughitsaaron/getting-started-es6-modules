# Getting started with ES6 Modules
This repository uses Babel and Rollup to make some ES6 modules. If you're curious about getting started with ES6 modules, you can clone this repo and play around with the modules and files here.

## Getting started
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
Run `npm run start` to run Rollup and execute the transpiled code in Node.

Rollup will output code already transpiled from Babel, so no need to run the code executed by the `start` script through another transpile step, e.g., `babel-node`.

## Questions/Contributing
Please help improve this example! PRs, issues, and questions are welcome.
